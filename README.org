Dark Forest - a nightmare platformer

* Theme

  You are alone in a forest. You cannot see the way home. You have a
  torch. When you use it, you might not be alone any more.

  The central game mechanic is based on cartoon logic. The Monsters
  never move the darkness. A pair of eyes only becomes active when you
  see who is behind it.

  Try not to get eaten and do not jump into bottomless pits! The
  fingerposts point to the next level.
